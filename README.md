# Day-53-55-56---Handling-Missing-Data-Data-Cleaning-and-Preprocessing-and-EDA
As part of a 75-day data analysis challenge, this work on Python covers handling missing data, data cleaning and pre-processing, and EDA

#### Introduction
The objective of the project is to design and implement a robust data preprocessing system. It addresses common challenges such as:

Handling missing values.
Managing outliers.
Resolving inconsistent formatting.
Mitigating noise in the data.
The ultimate goal is to enhance the quality, reliability, and usefulness of the data for machine learning applications.

#### Tasks Performed
The notebook contains around 30 code cells. Based on their content, the tasks likely include:

<b>Importing required libraries and loading the dataset.</b>

<b>Exploring the dataset (EDA):</b>
  Understanding the structure, data types, and summary statistics.
  Identifying missing values and outliers.

<b>Cleaning and preprocessing:</b>
  Handling missing data.
  Normalizing or scaling features.
  Encoding categorical variables.
  Managing inconsistent data entries.

<b>Feature engineering and selection:</b>
  Creating new features or removing irrelevant ones.

<b>Visualizing the data to gain insights.</b>
